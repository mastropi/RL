simulate: [reactivate=True] Generating trajectories for each particle until the first ACTIVATION after the burn-in period takes place... 
--> so that we can start the FV procedure.
simulate: Generating trajectories for each particle until first absorption... 
--> so that we can sort ALL the first absorption times of particles and start reactivating when reactivate=True.
--> Simulation time reset from T=1000.0 to T=62.8.
Generating trajectories for each particle until END OF SIMULATION (T=62.8)...

# Packages required specifically for the core RL part of the project, assuming that we are working on top of an Anaconda distribution of Python
# Hence, all Python 3 standard packages are assumed to be installed, which includes the packages listed here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html

# Packages listed in alphabetical order
# WARNING: Some of the packages are only available via `pip install` and NOT via `conda install` because conda does not have access to the PyPI repository
# (or it's not compatible with PyPI), which is where those packages are stored.

                # using v1.14 we need to adapt the code to the older way of changing the print options (already done in my code as of Jul-2021)

lib/queues/:
Q1) [2022/06/01] Move the definition of the QueueMM class to its own file: queuemm.py.
Goal: Keep in __init__.py only the definition of the generic queue class.
Challenge: How to keep naming the class QueueMM? I.e. how do we name the file where we define the class QueueMM and then intuitively import it?
(e.g. if we call the file queuemm.py then it is nonsense that we call the class defined therein QueueMM --as we would need to import it by doing `from queues.queuemm import QueueMM`;
on the other hand, we could call the file queues.py and then define the class MM therein, but this would imply that we would need to import it by doing `from queues.queues import MM`, still ridiculous the mention to `queues.queues`!)


lib/simulators.py:
S1) [DONE-2022/07/04] get_blocking_buffer_sizes() should compute the buffer sizes as the buffer sizes where the rejection probability is > 0. Currently the returned buffer sizes are K-1 and K where K is the buffer size at which blocking occurs with probability 1.


lib/environments/:
E1) Rename the getState() and setState() methods in the GenericEnv class defined in __init__.py to:
getStateIndex()
setStateIndex()
so that we reserve the `State` name to the actual (more complex) state defined in specific environments (e.g. 2D position in 2D gridworld, 2D (x, v) values in Mountain Car, etc.).


lib/:
L1) Move the estimators.py file to a new folder called "estimators".
Goal: Leave the root directory clean, with only the __init__.py file, the requirements.txt file, and any file that is used to run the process (e.g. run_FVRL.py).


test/:
T1) Remove any "runners" from the test files since test files should only be devoted to running UNIT tests.
Place runners in the root directory under file names called "run_...", e.g. run_FVRL.py.
